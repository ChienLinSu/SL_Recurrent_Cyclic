In this repository, we deposit the following files that we used in the paper "Analysis of cyclic recurrent event data with multiple event types" writted by Chien-Lin Su and Feng-Chang Lin.

1. The real dataset file, completedata.txt: This is the real data set we analyzed in the paper which is originally downloaded from        
    https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1346418578\#supplemental (Wang et al. (2012, Annals of Applied Statistics) ).

2. The R code for analyzing the real data set based on our proposed method.
